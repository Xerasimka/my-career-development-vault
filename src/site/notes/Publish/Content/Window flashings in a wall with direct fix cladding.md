#### Summary

I was sent an interesting articles going in-depth on what's the right way to replace existing windows in a wall with a direct-fixed cladding.

Apparently, a flexible flashing is required in corners of window opening and along the full length of the sill. The flashing would need to go over the wall underlay.


It is interesting. I have not seen anyone using flexible flashings, but at the same time I haven't had any buildings where we would need to put new windows in a direct fixed cladding.

#### Note for myself
Might be a good thing to remember if a Contractor says they can't replace window without changing cladding to the entire wall.
