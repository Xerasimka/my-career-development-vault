# Profiled Foam Closures in Metal Roofing: Why Avoid at Eaves

### Source

**Key takeaway**  
Putting profiled foam closures (commonly called "sponges" or foam fillers) under metal roof sheets **at the eaves** to stop wind-driven rain ingress is **not recommended** — and often prohibited. They severely restrict ventilation, leading to moisture buildup, mould, corrosion, and premature roof failure.

## Official Guidance
- **NZMRM Metal Roof and Wall Cladding Code of Practice**  
  Recommends profiled foam closures **only** where required for weathertightness (typically around windows in wall cladding) or for maintaining positive internal pressures in managed environments.  
  > "As they restrict the free movement of air, their use should be restricted to where they are required for weatherproofing and appearance (such as scribers under window jamb flashings) or for maintaining positive internal pressures, such as in building with a managed internal environment. Profiled closures should be of closed cell type, rather than bitumen impregnated."

- **Acceptable Solution E2/AS1**  
  Explicit prohibition at eaves:  
  > 8.4.15 Profile Closure  
  > "Preformed compressible seals shall not be used at the eaves."

## Types of Closures
- **Narrow Tipped** — fits under the profile (e.g., for scribers under window jamb flashings).  
- **Wide Tipped** — fits over the profile.

## Why Avoid Them (Especially at Eaves)
- **Blocks ventilation** → Build-up of excessive internal moisture  
  - Causes **mould** growth (health risk in dwellings)  
  - Accelerates **corrosion** of sheets, purlins, and structure  
  - Prevents dissipation of corrosive emissions (e.g., in freight depots)  
  - Increases **time of wetness** → premature failure (examples show severe damage after ~14 years)

- **Practical issues**  
  - Hard to keep in place → often fall into gutters, blocking water flow  
  - Degrade quickly from heat and reflected UV (break down after several years)

## Better Alternatives
- **Remove the foam** in most details — simplest fix where not strictly needed for weathertightness.  
- **Vermin exclusion at eaves** → Use an **eaves comb** (durable, allows ventilation, more effective long-term).

## When They Might Be Acceptable
- Specific wall cladding situations (e.g., under window jamb flashings for appearance/weatherproofing).  
- Atmosphere-controlled / low-energy buildings requiring managed internal pressure.

*Lesson learned: Ventilation trumps foam fillers at eaves — prioritise airflow to prevent long-term damage.*
