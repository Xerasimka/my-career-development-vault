# Profiled Foam Closures in Metal Roofing: Why Avoid at Eaves

## Key lesson 
Using profiled foam closures under metal roof sheets at the eaves to block wind-driven rain is **not recommended** and often prohibited. They restrict ventilation, causing moisture build-up, mould, corrosion and early roof failure.

## Official Guidance
- **NZMRM Code of Practice**  
  Use only where required for weathertightness (e.g. around windows) or controlled internal pressure.  
  > “As they restrict the free movement of air, their use should be restricted… Profiled closures should be of closed cell type.”

- **E2/AS1**  
  > 8.4.15 “Preformed compressible seals shall not be used at the eaves.”

## Types
- Narrow tipped – fits under profile  
- Wide tipped – fits over profile

## Main Problems
- **Blocks ventilation** → excessive internal moisture  
  • Mould growth (dwellings)  
  • Corrosion of sheets & purlins  
  • Longer “time of wetness” → premature failure (seen after ~14 years)  
  • Poor dissipation of vehicle emissions (freight depots)
- **Practical issues**  
  • Often fall into gutters, blocking water flow  
  • Degrade from heat & reflected UV after a few years

## Better Options
- **Remove the foam** where not essential for weathertightness  
- **Vermin control at eaves** → use an **eaves comb** (durable, allows airflow)

## When Acceptable
- Window jamb flashings / scribers  
- Atmosphere-controlled buildings

*Takeaway: Prioritise ventilation over foam fillers at eaves to prevent long-term damage.*
