Today ([[Publish/3. Daily logs/2026-01-23\|2026-01-23]]) I had a chance to meet with Starke, a facade solutions company.
It was nice to feel that I know enough about a particular field to maintain a meaningful conversation with the representatives.

I learned that curtain walls are starting to pay off only after 4 storeys of  installation. If less than that, the conventional approach is more economical. 

Main drivers for the cost benefits, when it comes to curtain walls: 
- no need to scaffold
- very quickly to install (except the top and the bottom, where additional work is required)

They also confirmed what I suspected for a long time: energy efficiency of thermally broken profile does not offset the costs of the more expensive system. Unless money is not a question, it is reasonable to stick to the non-broken profile. However, they did noted that the difference in comfort will be noticable.
