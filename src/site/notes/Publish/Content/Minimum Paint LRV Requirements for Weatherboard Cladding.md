## Key Lesson Learned
My chosen paint colour had an **LRV of 30**, which is too dark for weatherboard (timber) cladding. Many manufacturers and systems require a **minimum LRV of 45** (some specify ≥40%).

## What is LRV?
**Light Reflectance Value (LRV)** measures the percentage of visible light a painted surface reflects (scale: 0 = pure black/absorbs all light → 100 = pure white/reflects all light).

- Lower LRV = darker colour → absorbs more solar heat
- Higher LRV = lighter colour → reflects more heat

## Why the Minimum LRV Requirement Exists
Dark colours on timber weatherboards absorb excessive heat → core timber temperature rises → problems include:

- Excessive timber movement / expansion & contraction
- Increased risk of **resin bleed** (especially in radiata pine / finger-jointed timber)
- Faster paint degradation, cracking, or peeling
- Potential voiding of product warranty / guarantee

Many pre-primed or treated timber weatherboard suppliers (e.g. common NZ/AU systems like EnviroPine, JSC, Niagara/Envira, OTC, etc.) explicitly state in their technical guidelines:

> Use only paints with **LRV ≥ 45%** (and often gloss ≥10% for durability)

Some fibre-cement or insulated systems allow down to 40% or even 25% with special "CoolColour" technology, but **standard timber weatherboards are stricter** (usually 45%).

## NZ Building Code Context
The NZBC itself does not mandate a specific LRV for timber cladding (it's not a direct code clause).  
The **minimum LRV requirements come from manufacturer specifications** and product appraisals / warranties / CodeMark certifications.

## Practical Takeaways for Future Projects
- Always check the **specific cladding manufacturer's technical data sheet** for LRV limits before selecting colour.
- LRV < 45 almost always disqualifies very dark / near-black shades on standard timber weatherboards.
- For darker looks, consider:
  - Specialised timber products designed for low-LRV colours (e.g. thermally modified timber)
  - "CoolColour" / infrared-reflective paint technology (still check if accepted by cladding supplier)
  - Non-timber cladding options (some allow LRV 25–40%)
- Paint suppliers (e.g. Resene) publish LRV values for each colour — verify before purchase.

**Personal note:** My LRV 30 colour was rejected — next selection must be ≥45 LRV to stay within warranty and performance guidelines.
