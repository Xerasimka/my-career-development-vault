I realised I never asked myself 


Under **clause 10.4** of _NZS 3910:2013_, Practical Completion is the formal point at which the Works are considered complete **except for minor omissions or defects** that meet the criteria in **10.4.1(a)–(c)** 1.  
The PCC is important because:

- **It formally records the date and time Practical Completion is achieved**, issued by the Engineer under **10.4.3(a)** or **10.4.4** and in the format of Schedule 15 21.
- **It stops the Contractor’s exposure to liquidated damages**, because liquidated damages only apply up to the time of Practical Completion (clause **10.5.1**) 1.
- **It triggers the start of the Defects Notification Period**, since this period begins on the date of Practical Completion (Schedule 2 amendment to clause **11.1**) 3.
- **It enables Principal occupancy or use** under **10.7.1** (once PCC is issued) 1.
- **It is required for bond release**—the Principal must notify the surety to release the Contractor’s bond within 5 working days after PCC (Guidelines **G3.1.7**) 1.
- **It is a prerequisite for issuing Final Completion**—Final Completion cannot occur until all defects notified after PCC are remedied (Guidelines **G11.3**) 1.
