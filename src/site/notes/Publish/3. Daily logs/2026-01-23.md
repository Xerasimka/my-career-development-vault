#### Mood & health
Had a lovely morning this day.
Noticed FOV change on the way to work. It faded away mid-morning, but still was lovely to experience it.

#### Remarkable events:
We had an interesting lunch & learn today: [[Publish/Content/Lunch & learn - Starke facades\|Lunch & learn - Starke facades]]
Plenty of smiles from G, positive working environment. 

#### Productivity
Noting the day was shorter (due to the aforementioned event and social drinks at the end), the day was quite productive.
